**Power Management system in Hotels Using PC**

_Duration: 8 Jan'17 - 30 Mar'17_

This project was developed keeping smart city and energy efficiency in mind. This project is useful in all applications where automation of electrical appliances is required. We made use of embedded technology whose closed loop feedback control system is very efficient and reliable. Project was developed using Arduino’s microcontroller (ATmega328) which allows dynamic and faster control of appliances and is the heart of the circuit as it controls all the functions.
The main aim of this project is to control electrical appliances and save power by means of PC using PC’s Standalone GUI application. The person sitting in the reception can continuously check the loads being operated in the rooms and can switch off them wherever not required just by sitting in front of his PC. TRIAC was used to control the loads and its main advantage is that it reduces the energy flow to the loads and TRIAC works very well for alternating currents.

**My Role in Project:** I wrote a standalone GUI application using C# and programmed the microcontroller in Arduino language.

**Automatic Irrigation System on Sensing Soil Moisture Content**

_Duration: 1 May'16 - 30 Jul'16_

In the field of agriculture, use of proper method of irrigation is important. The project is designed to develop an automatic irrigation system which switches the pump motor ON/OFF on sensing the moisture content of the soil. The advantage of using this method is to reduce human intervention and still ensure proper irrigation. Once the controller receives this signal, it generates an output that drives a relay for operating the water pump. An LCD display is also interfaced to the microcontroller to display status of the soil and water pump. The sensing arrangement is made by using two stiff metallic rods inserted into the field at a distance. Connections from the metallic rods are interfaced to the control unit.The concept in future can be enhanced by integrating GSM technology, such that whenever the water pump switches ON/OFF, an SMS is delivered to the concerned person regarding the status of the pump. We can also control the pump through SMS.

**My Role in Project:** I wrote the embedded c code and simulated the project in Proteus. I also regularly performed the test to determine if the parts were working correctly.
